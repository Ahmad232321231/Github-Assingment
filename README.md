# The Tech Academy – Basic C# Projects

Welcome! This repository contains my solutions and practice work for **The Tech Academy's Basic C# course**.

## 📁 Structure
Each project lives in its own folder:
- `ProjectName/`
  - `ProjectName.sln`
  - `ProjectName/` (source code)
  - `README.md` (project-specific notes, if needed)

> Tip: Keep each project self-contained so it can be opened directly in Visual Studio.

## ✅ Goals
- Practice C# fundamentals (types, methods, classes, exceptions)
- Learn .NET project structure and debugging
- Use Git/GitHub for version control and submissions

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Open the `.sln` in **Visual Studio** (or `dotnet` CLI if using .NET SDK).
2. Build and run (Ctrl + F5).
3. Check console/app output and commit improvements as you go.

## 🔀 Git Workflow (Quick Reference)
```bash
# after you clone the repo locally
git add .
git commit -m "Add initial C# project(s)"
git push origin main
```
Make small, frequent commits with clear messages.

## 📝 Notes
- This repository includes only coursework-related material.
- If you use any external resources, cite them in your project notes.
- Keep your `bin/` and `obj/` folders out of version control (see .gitignore).
